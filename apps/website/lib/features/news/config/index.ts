    content: `Taiwan's commitment to open data has spawned numerous innovative projects that benefit society. This month we spotlight three remarkable success stories.

**Project 1: Public Transport Accessibility Map**
A volunteer-driven initiative mapping wheelchair accessibility across Taipei's MRT system. Using open government data on station facilities, the project created an interactive map helping people with mobility challenges plan their journeys.

**Project 2: Air Quality Prediction Model**
Researchers combined environmental monitoring data with weather patterns to create accurate air quality forecasts. The model now helps thousands of people make informed decisions about outdoor activities.

**Project 3: School Lunch Nutrition Tracker**
Parents developed a platform tracking nutritional content of school meals using education department data. The tool has influenced policy changes improving meal quality across multiple school districts.

These projects demonstrate how open data, combined with civic engagement, can drive meaningful change. Each started as a weekend project and grew into essential community resources.`,
